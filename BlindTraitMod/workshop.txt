visibility=public
description=[Update 1.1] Should now work properly in multiplayer (though, if you want a blind player to have shaders you may need to disable lua checksum)

The game features 5.1 sound, Vo-Ip, and a lot of ambiant sounds like zombies footsteps, etc... So I decided to give you the ability to play a blind character, to focus more on sounds.

I also worked on a shader to inprove the blind character experience.

Features :

- You can pick a new trait that allows you to play a blind character (+16 malus)
- The blind player has a really tiny "seeing" sight where you can see zombies even behind you
- You can't de-zoom + everytime you look away the screen gets darker (keep your cursor close to your player while sneaking !)
- You have excellent hearing
- Use the new "Greyscale and shadows" shader for a better blind experience
- Change the "Sight halo" to fit the new x2 textures

HOW TO ACTIVATE THE SHADERS WHILE PLAYING A BLIND CHARACTER :

Follow the instructions inside the "shaders_instructions.txt" file in the mod folder which should be located there :
