title=Blind Trait Mod  - 1.2
description=[Update 1.2] Should now work properly in multiplayer (though, if you want a blind player to have shaders you may need to disable lua checksum)

description=The game features 5.1 sound, Vo-Ip, and a lot of ambiant sounds like zombies footsteps, etc... So I decided to give you the ability to play a blind character, to focus more on sounds.

description=I also worked on a shader to inprove the blind character experience.

description=Features :

description=- You can pick a new trait that allows you to play a blind character (+16 malus)

description=- You can't de-zoom + everytime you look away the screen gets darker (keep your cursor close to your player while sneaking !)
description=- You have excellent hearing
description=- Use the new "Greyscale and shadows" shader for a better blind experience
description=- Change the "Sight halo" to fit the new x2 textures
