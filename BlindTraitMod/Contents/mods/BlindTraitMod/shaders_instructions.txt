--                  INSTRUCTIONS CONCERNING SHADERS                     --
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to play with the best experience you will need to activate the shaders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to activate shaders (when playing with a blind character) :

1. Launch the game and make sure the mod is enabled
2. Then quit the game
3. Go to the mod folder :
- If you are using steam workshop this should be :
  your-steam-repository/steamapps/workshop/content/108600/546189296/mods/BlindTraitMod/media/
- If you are not using steam workshop this should be :
  your-user-repository/Zomboid/mods/BlindTraitMod/media/
4. Rename the the "shaders-off" folder into "shaders"
5. Launch the game and play a blind character (Don't forget to pick the trait !)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Follow these steps to activate shaders (when playing with a normal character) :

1. Go to the mod folder :
- If you are using steam workshop :
  your-steam-repository/steamapps/workshop/content/108600/546189296/mods/BlindTraitMod/media/
- If you are not using steam workshop :
  your-user-repository/Zomboid/mods/BlindTraitMod/media/
4. Rename the the "shaders" folder into "shaders-off"
5. Launch the game and play a normal character without being anoyed by the shader

Sadly, shaders are considered as a base game modification.
In order to play with it on a server, the server owner should authorise
clients having diferent game files.
